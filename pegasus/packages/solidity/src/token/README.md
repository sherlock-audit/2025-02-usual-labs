# USUALSP (USUALS Allocation)

## High-Level Overview
The **UsualSP** contract is a smart contract designed for managing the vesting and staking of **USUALS** token allocations. It allows insiders to vest and claim their **USUALS** allocations over a pre-defined vesting period and provides users (both insiders and outsiders) the ability to stake **USUALS** tokens to receive yield in the form of liquid allocations and rewards in **USUAL** tokens. Insiders can claim their vested **USUALS** allocations after a user-specific cliff period (multiple of the **ONE_MONTH** constant), and these tokens are distributed in monthly increments.

## Contract Summary
### Inherited Contracts

- **RewardAccrualBase**: Base contract that handles the reward accrual mechanism for staked tokens.
- **PausableUpgradeable**: Allows contract functionality to be paused by authorized accounts (OZ implementation).
- **ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable**: Prevents reentrant attacks on sensitive functions (OZ implementation).
- **IUsualSP**: Interface defining the required methods for the **UsualSP** contract.
  
## Functionality Breakdown
### Key Functionalities

- **Vesting**: Insiders receive an initial **USUALS allocation** that is vested over a defined period. This allocation is released gradually, with insiders able to claim it from their start time and after their cliff period has passed.
- **Claiming USUALS Allocations**: Insiders can claim their vested **USUALS** after the cliff period is over. The claimable amount is calculated based on the duration passed since the vesting started.
- **Staking**: Users (including insiders) can stake their **USUALS** tokens to receive liquid allocations and rewards in **USUAL** tokens. These rewards accrue over time and can be claimed.
- **Reward Accrual**: Users who stake **USUALS** tokens are eligible for rewards in **USUAL** tokens based on the staking duration and amount.
- **Pause and Unpause**: Authorized roles have the ability to pause and unpause the contract to safeguard against attacks or during upgrades.

## Functions Description
### Public/External Functions
