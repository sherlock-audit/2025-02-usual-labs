# UsualM

The **UsualM** is an extension of **$M** / [**WrappedM**](https://github.com/m0-foundation/wrapped-m-token) (wrapped version of the M token) by M^0. It is an ERC20 token and it allows users to wrap WrappedM tokens into UsualM, adding enhanced functionality such as pausability, blacklist enforcement, and mint cap restrictions. It also supports permits and implements role-based access control to ensure secure operations.

See official [Usual documentation](https://tech.usual.money/smart-contracts/real-world-assets/m-by-m0/usualm) for more details.
